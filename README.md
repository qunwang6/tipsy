# Tipsy

_A simple tip calculator and bill divider PWA_

Figuring out how much you should add to the total bill for a tip, or how much
everyone should pay when ordering as a group can be difficult (even more so if
you've "had a few"). Let Tipsy do the math for you! It calculates the tip
percentage, tip amount, grand total, and how much each person should contribute
when in a group. No more guess work.

### Usage

Tipsy is a [progressive web app][pwa], intended to be used exclusively on mobile
phones. Because it is a web site, you can obviously access it from any device,
but all design choices have been made with phone usage in mind (and particularly
those with larger screens).
