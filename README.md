# Tipsy

_A simple tip calculator and bill divider PWA_

[![Build Status][ci-image]][ci-url]

### Pitch

Figuring out how much you should add to the total bill for a tip, or how much
everyone should pay when ordering as a group can be difficult (even more so if
you've "had a few"). Let Tipsy do the math for you! It calculates the tip
percentage, tip amount, grand total, and how much each person should contribute
when in a group. No more guess work.

### Origin

A friend of mine was using a popular mobile app for tipping and splitting bills,
but it had become so bogged down with ads that it was basically unusable. In
response, I created a [free and open source clone][nip-the-tip] for him to use
instead. This is a recreation of that native Androidâ„¢ app using web
technologies.

### Usage

Tipsy is a [progressive web app][pwa], intended to be used exclusively on mobile
phones. Because it is on the web, you can access it from any device with a
modern web browser - but all design choices have been made with phone usage in
mind (and particularly those with larger screens).
